# seedingWithEA
testingEA.py contains an evolutionary algorithm that optimizes the seeding algorithm configuration from the acts-project.

Utilizes my local copy of acts-project to run with a modified print output and modified seeding algorithm.

testingScript.py contains a script to plot the efficiency and number of seeds generated versus a configurable parameter. Utilizes multiprocessing.
